 #Color Detection from Images
 
In many creative and technical fields—such as graphic design, UI/UX, and digital art—precisely identifying colors from images is essential. The "Color Detection from Images" project is designed to help users detect and understand the color composition of an image in an intuitive and interactive way. Users can upload an image, click on any part of it, and immediately view the color name and RGB values of the selected pixel.

#AI-Powered Movie Recommendation System 

With the vast number of movies available on streaming platforms, users often face difficulty finding films that match their preferences quickly. The AI-Powered Movie Recommendation System addresses this challenge by leveraging machine learning techniques to provide personalized movie suggestions based on user input. Using content-based filtering methods such as TF-IDF and cosine similarity, the system analyzes movie descriptions and metadata to recommend titles similar to the user’s choice. This creates a more engaging, efficient, and tailored viewing experience.
